## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Keep your server updated to the latest version
- Use strong API keys when authentication is enabled
- Configure proper CORS origins for production
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Regularly review and rotate API keys
- Monitor server logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers

- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate URLs before processing
- Use appropriate rate limiting
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies updated

## Security Features

The Readability Server includes several security features:

- **API Key Authentication:** Optional API key protection
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **CORS Protection:** Configurable cross-origin requests
- **Security Headers:** Helmet.js for security headers
- **Input Validation:** Request validation and sanitization
- **Content Security Policy:** XSS protection

## Known Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization

The Readability Server processes HTML content from external sources. While we implement basic sanitization, you should:

- Use additional sanitization libraries like [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) for user-generated content
- Validate and sanitize URLs before processing
- Implement proper output encoding

### Content Processing

- The server fetches content from external URLs
- Malicious websites could potentially serve harmful content
- Consider implementing additional security measures for production use

### API Key Security

- Use strong, unique API keys
- Store API keys securely
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Monitor for unauthorized usage

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions when possible
- Documented in the CHANGELOG.md
- Communicated through GitHub releases
- Prioritized over feature development

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until they are fixed
- We will work with security researchers to coordinate disclosure
- We will provide appropriate credit to security researchers
- We will maintain confidentiality during the investigation process
